# Weather app

This is a functioning example of an app to check the weather for the next 5 days.

## Use cases

The user will be able to choose if geolocation should be used:
- if yes, the default weather will be based on user's location, but another location can still be searched;
- if not, the user must manually search a location.

Bonuses:
- users can see the details of a single day;
- users can save favourites cities.
